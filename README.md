# SharedTaxi - A Reinforcement Learning Environment
The environment mimics a shared taxi with two passengers and helps in training autonomous agents. The environment is "generic" and adapts to the dimensions specified while initializing it. It balances taxi capacity and passenger(s) pickup/drop, however, preference is always given to a passenger(s) pickup and drop.
